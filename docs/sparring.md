# Sparring/Kumite

Kumite is a controlled form of fighting. There are different forms, corresponding to the degree of control over the movements.

A simple form is ippon kumite, or one-step sparring which consists of a single attack and corresponding defence. Other forms include san dan gi, involving 3 steps, 3 attacks at 3 different levels, and the corresponding defences.

Randori is continuous attack and defence, emphasising technique and combinations, but with minimal contact.

Jiyu kumite is at full speed with some hard contact particularly to the body.

Go kumite is full contact.

In all cases, emphasis is on safety and control. Safety equipment is often used, particularly for Go kumite. Even with the lighter forms, a mouth guard should be considered the absolute minimum.

## General Tips

- Don't beat up your opponent, we're all here to practise, not to brawl.
- Use angles as a way to avoid your opponents attacks and as a way to attack your opponent where they're vulnerable.
- Use combinations, one punch is easy to deal with, but 4 punches and a kick is a lot more difficult to handle.
- Keep your guard/hands up, getting punched in the face sucks.
- Don't look where you're going to attack as it will give away your intentions
- Be relaxed as much as possible. Being tense will tire you out and slow you down.
- Keep control of your breathing, if you run out of breath it's game over.
- Don't let your opponent control the tempo of the fight, you can let them think they are though.
- Keep light on your feet to move quickly
- Use your hips to move faster and to generate more power
