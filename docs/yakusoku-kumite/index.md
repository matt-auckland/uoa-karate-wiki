# Yakusoku Kumite

Yakusoku Kumite translates as pre-arranged sparring.

The following are 10 sets of prearranged attacks and defences. The defences apply kata techniques, you could consider these to be another set of formal bunkai for our kata. Some of them are quite similar to our usual formal bunkai and others are more advanced, featuring various throws and takedowns, as well as locks and ground techniques.

## Video

<Wiki-Video url="https://youtu.be/7uLmo07gQaA" />

Note: Some of the techniques in the video differ from what is written on this page. This page is a mix of [David Reddaway Sensei's notes](yakusoku-kumite-david-reddaway.md), the notes in the [IOGKFNZ instructor's manual](yakusoku-kumite-iogkfnz.md), what is shown in the video, and some additional editing to for things like spelling and for clarification of the instructions.

The number of applications shown in the video also differs from what is written here. IOGKNZ's notes feature 41 techniques, Reddaway Sensei's notes feature 43 techniques, while the video features only 35 by my count.
