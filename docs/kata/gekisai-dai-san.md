# Gekisai Dai San

<Infobox/>

A supplemental Goju Ryu Karate kata, seemingly created in collaboration between [Uehara Kou](/docs/people/uehara-kou.md) (student of Eiichi Miyazato) and South African Karateka, as a bridge between the simpler Gekisai Kata and Saifa. This Kata introduces a number of open handed techniques and the concept of attacking with one hand while not chambering the other.

Not to be confused with the other [Gekisai Dai San](/docs/kata/gekisai-dai-san.md) which has the same name. 

## Name Meaning

When you interpret the kanji characters for 'Gekisai' individually, you get something more like "Attack & Destroy".
Taken as a single word, Gekisai（撃砕）means "Pulverising​". Dai Ichi（第一）means "Number Three".
So "Attack & Destory Number Three" or "Pulverising Number Three", the former is the more popular interpretation.
The reason for the "number three" is because Gekisai Dai San is thr third in a series of kata.
