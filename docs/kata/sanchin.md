# Sanchin

<Infobox/>

## Name Meaning

The name "Sanchin" is composed of the characters "Three" (<ruby><rb>三</rb><rt>さん</rt></ruby>) and "Battle"(<ruby><rb>戦</rb><rt>ちん</rt></ruby>), thus meaning "Three Battles".　 These battles are commonly thought to be the battles of the mind, body and spirit; which can all be improved by the practice of Sanchin, or so the story goes.

## Kata History

It is said that [Kanryo Higashionna] was the one who changed Sanchin's open hands into closed fists. This is supported by the fact that all the karate styles that spawned from Higashionna (Goju Ryu, Shito Ryu, Tōon-ryū) have close fisted Sanchin.

[Chojun Miyagi] learned this kata from [Kanryo Higaonna] and made several changes to it:

- The method of breathing became harder, it's said the orginal was softer.
- The footwork was simplified, the turns that existed in the kata were removed, and the stepping was changed so as to perform fewer steps.

Two main versions of 'Sanchin' now exist in [Goju Ryu], "Higashionna", and "Miyagi". "Higashionna" retains the turns of Higashionna's original version. "Higashionna Sanchin" is also known as "Sanchin Dai Ni"
