# Gekisai Dai Ichi

<Infobox/>

The first [kata](/) taught in modern Goju Ryu. It was created to help popularise Karate. It is the only kata in Goju Ryu that ends with a step forward instead of a step backward.

## Name Meaning

### Gekisai Dai Ichi

When you interpret the kanji characters for 'Gekisai' individually, you get something more like "Attack & Destroy".
Taken as a single word, Gekisai（撃砕）means "Pulverising​". Dai Ichi（第一）means "Number One".
So "Attack & Destory Number One" or "Pulverising Number One", the former is the more popular interpretation.
The reason for the "number one" is because Gekisai Dai Ichi is from a pair of kata, the other being Gekisai Dai Ni（撃砕第二）.

### Fukyu Gata Ni

Fukyu (普及) means "Popularisation", "Gata" is another way of saying "Kata" and 二 is "Two".  
This name means "Popularisation Kata Two". For more info on this, see the history section.

## Kata History

It was created to help popularise Karate in the 1940s by Chojun Miyagi with the help of a Shorin Ryu Sensei. It introduced Jodan Uke into the Goju Ryu syllabus.
