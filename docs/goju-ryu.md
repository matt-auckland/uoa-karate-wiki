## The Badge

<Wiki-Img float src="/logo.png"/>

Heaven and earth are described as “kenkon” in Japanese. “Ken” indicates heaven and “kon” indicates earth. Heaven is shown as round and earth as square, symbolising the vastness of heaven and earth. Heaven relates to softness and earth to hardness.
The badge expresses harmony of hardness and softness in nature - heaven and earth.

The meaning of “Goju” is directly related to the badge since this also means hard and soft – “go” meaning hard and “ju” meaning soft. No emphasis is placed upon Chojun Miyagi since the idea stands from an international point of view. However, it is necessary to explain that the symbol within the circle is the family crest of the Miyagi family.
