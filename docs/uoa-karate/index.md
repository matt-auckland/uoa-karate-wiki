Founded in 2003 by Sensei Ewan Tempero (5th degree Black Belt) and Sensei Tom Davies (4th degree Black Belt), the Auckland University Goju Ryu Karate Club has been running for over 20 years and counting.

The club is affiliated with the <a href="https://iogkf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Okinawan Goju Ryu Federation (IOGKF)</a>, an international body dedicated to preserving the art
of Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate, as well as the New Zealand branch organization, <a href="https://karate.org.nz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IOGKFNZ</a>.
This gives club members access to expert intructors and the ability to attend training camps/seminars around the country and the world.

## Club Events

We try to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere at the club and as part of this we regularly hold all kinds of social events.
Some examples: Our own 'Karate Camp', weekend training seminars, dinner/lunches after training, group movie viewings, trainings at the beach, and other group outings around Auckland. We also participate in tournaments multiple times a year and attend training camps around New Zealand (and occassionally overseas!).
