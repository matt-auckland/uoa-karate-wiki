## Tips

- Keep your elbow down, don't let it point out to the side (flaring prevents your back muscles from helping)
- Try to relax as much as possible, using excess power will just slow you down and tire you out
  - Of course if you want to train your muscular endurance, putting excess power into kakie is a good way to do so
